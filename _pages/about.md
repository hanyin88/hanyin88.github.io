I am a Co-Director of AI Validation and Stewardship at Mayo Clinic Health System and a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jimeng Sun. Before this, I received my MD degree and completed my residency training.

**[Research]** My research focuses on developing and validating Large Language Models for healthcare applications. The core of my work involves addressing various challenges in clinical AI, including model safety, reliability, and practical deployment in healthcare settings.

**[Application]** I co-lead the development of healthcare-focused LLMs and have published work on DRG prediction, clinical note generation, and AI validation in healthcare. My recent work includes **DRG-LLaMA**, a specialized model for predicting diagnosis-related groups in hospitalized patients, which has been published in npj Digital Medicine and has received significant attention in the medical AI community.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical clinical applications, ensuring that AI systems are both effective and safe for patient care.
