I am an Internal Medicine Physician at Mayo Clinic Health System and a Computer Science PhD candidate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jimeng Sun. Before this, I received my MD degree and completed my residency training in Internal Medicine.

I am passionate about developing and validating Large Language Models for healthcare applications, with a focus on addressing real-world clinical challenges through innovations in clinical note generation and reinforcement learning approaches. I am also actively exploring startup opportunities to translate these research advances into practical healthcare solutions.
